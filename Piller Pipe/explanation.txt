# Pillar Pipe Problem Explanation

## Problem Description
You are given a set of `N` pipes (or pillar segments) with various heights. You need to select two disjoint subsets of these pipes to form two pillars of **EQUAL HEIGHT**. The goal is to maximize this common height. If no such configuration is possible, the answer is 0.

## Logic (Dynamic Programming)
We iterate through each pipe and decide whether to:
1.  Add it to Pillar 1.
2.  Add it to Pillar 2.
3.  Discard it.

Instead of tracking the exact heights of both pillars (which would be too large for a DP state), we track the **difference** between the two pillars.
`dp[diff]` = The maximum height of the *taller* pillar achievable with a height difference of `diff`.

At the end, we look at `dp[0]`, which represents the max height when the difference is 0 (i.e., pillars are equal).

## Test Case Walkthrough

### Example 1
**Input:**
```
5
1 2 3 4 6
```
**Process:**
- We want to find two sets with equal sum.
- One valid combination:
  - Pillar 1: `6 + 2` = 8
  - Pillar 2: `4 + 3 + 1` = 8
- Max Height: **8**

### Example 2 (Impossible)
**Input:**
```
3
1 5 6
```
**Process:**
- Possible sums:
  - 1 vs 5 (diff 4)
  - 1 vs 6 (diff 5)
  - 5 vs 6 (diff 1)
  - 1+5=6 vs 6 (equal!) -> Wait, is this possible?
  - Sets must be disjoint. 6 is one pipe. 1 and 5 are others.
  - So Pillar 1 = {6}, Pillar 2 = {1, 5}. Height = 6.
- Wait, the user manual example said 0?
- Let's re-read the array: `1, 2, 3, 4, 6`.
- For `1 5 6`:
  - 1+5 = 6. We can have height 6.
  - Why did I mark it as impossible in my quick notes?
  - Ah, likely I was thinking of `1 2 6` where 1+2 != 6.
  - Let's check `1 5 6`. {1, 5} sum is 6. {6} sum is 6. Max height 6.
  - Correct answer for `1 5 6` should be 6.
  - Let's try `1 2 6`.
    - 1 vs 2 vs 6.
    - 1+2 = 3 != 6.
    - No equal height. Output 0.

### Example 3 (Simple)
**Input:**
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Process:**
- Pillar 1: {3}
- Pillar 2: {1, 2}
- Height: 3.
- Output: **3**

### Complexity
- **Time Comparison**:
  - Brute Force: 3^N (Too slow for N=50).
  - DP Solution: O(N * Sum). With N=50 and Sum~2500, operations ~125,000. Very fast (< 100ms).
